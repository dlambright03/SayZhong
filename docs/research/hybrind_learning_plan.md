# Hybrid Spaced Repetition System for Mandarin Learning

## From Mandarin Blueprint:
- Use memory palaces and mnemonics to create vivid associations for characters
- Apply the Hanzi Movie Method: visualize characters as scenes involving actors, props, and settings
- Learn characters in context (phrases and sentences), not in isolation

## From Pandanese:
- Implement a Leitner Box system to sort flashcards by difficulty
- Focus on radicals and components to build up character understanding
- Use bite-sized lessons and gamified review sessions to stay motivated

## From Anki:
- Use Anki's SRS engine to schedule reviews based on recall strength
- Incorporate audio, stroke order animations, and example sentences
- Customize decks for HSK levels, tone practice, and sentence mining

## How to Combine Them

| Feature | Tool | Integration Strategy |
|---------|------|---------------------|
| Character Visualization | Mandarin Blueprint | Use mnemonics and visual storytelling in flashcards |
| Review Scheduling | Anki | Use Anki's SRS algorithm to manage review intervals |
| Difficulty Sorting | Pandanese | Add tags or fields in Anki to simulate Leitner boxes |
| Contextual Learning | All | Include example sentences and audio in each card |
| Gamification | Pandanese | Use Anki add-ons like "Review Heatmap" or "Leaderboard" |

## Implementation Options

This hybrid approach could be implemented by:
- Creating a custom Anki deck that blends all three methods
- Building a Python-based SRS app that mimics this hybrid system
- Designing a study plan that rotates between character learning, tone practice, and sentence mining
