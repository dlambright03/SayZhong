# Streamlit: Advanced Features and Limitations

Streamlit is a powerful open-source Python library that makes it easy to build and share custom web apps for machine learning and data science. While it's known for its simplicity and speed, it also offers advanced features that can support more complex applications. Here's a breakdown of its advanced capabilities and limitations:

## Advanced Features of Streamlit

### Custom Components

- You can build or integrate JavaScript-based components using the `streamlit.components.v1` module
- Enables embedding of interactive visualizations like Plotly Dashboards, D3.js charts, or even full React apps

### Session State Management

- `st.session_state` allows you to maintain state across user interactions, enabling multi-step workflows, form memory, and dynamic UI updates

### Theming and Layout Customization

- Custom themes via `.streamlit/config.toml` or programmatically
- Layouts using `st.columns`, `st.expander`, and `st.container` for more structured UIs

### Bi-directional Communication

- With custom components, you can send data back and forth between Python and JavaScript, enabling real-time updates and interactivity

### Caching and Performance Optimization

- `@st.cache_data` and `@st.cache_resource` decorators help optimize performance by caching expensive computations or data loads

### Authentication and Deployment

- Streamlit Community Cloud supports simple OAuth-based login
- For enterprise use, you can integrate with SSO providers and deploy via Docker, Kubernetes, or cloud platforms

### Streaming and Real-Time Updates

- `st.empty()` and `st.spinner()` allow for dynamic content updates and loading indicators
- Useful for live dashboards or progress tracking

### File Uploads and Downloads

- `st.file_uploader` and `st.download_button` support user interaction with files, enabling data ingestion and export

## Limitations of Streamlit

### Limited Native Interactivity

- Unlike Dash or Shiny, Streamlit lacks native support for complex interactivity like callbacks between widgets without workarounds

### Single-Threaded Execution

- Streamlit apps run in a single Python thread, which can be a bottleneck for CPU-intensive tasks unless offloaded to background threads or services

### No Built-in Database ORM

- You need to integrate external libraries (like SQLAlchemy) for database interactions

### Limited Multi-User Support

- While Streamlit handles multiple sessions, it doesn't natively support collaborative or multi-user editing features

### JavaScript Dependency for Custom Components

- Advanced UI elements require JavaScript knowledge, which may be a barrier for Python-only developers

### Security and Access Control

- Streamlit Community Cloud has basic access control; enterprise-grade security requires self-hosting or third-party tools
