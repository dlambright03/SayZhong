Phonetic approximation systems for Mandarin Chinese and Pinyin are designed to help non-native speakers pronounce Mandarin words more accurately or to transcribe Mandarin sounds using different scripts or phonetic systems. Here's an overview of the most prominent systems:
1. Hanyu Pinyin (汉语拼音)
Purpose: Official romanization system for Standard Mandarin in mainland China.
Features:
Uses the Latin alphabet.
Includes tone marks (e.g., mā, má, mǎ, mà).
Widely used in education, dictionaries, and input methods.
Example: 北京 → Běijīng
2. Wade-Giles
Purpose: Older romanization system developed in the 19th century.
Features:
Uses apostrophes and hyphens to indicate aspiration and syllable boundaries.
Still used in Taiwan and in older Western texts.
Example: 北京 → Pei-ching
3. Yale Romanization
Purpose: Developed during WWII for teaching Mandarin to English speakers.
Features:
Designed to be intuitive for English speakers.
Uses tone numbers instead of diacritics.
Example: 北京 → Běijīng → Bei3jing1
4. Zhuyin Fuhao (Bopomofo)
Purpose: Phonetic script used primarily in Taiwan.
Features:
Uses unique symbols instead of Latin letters.
Often used in educational materials for children.
Example: 北京 → ㄅㄟˇ ㄐㄧㄥ
5. IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet)
Purpose: Linguistic tool for precise phonetic transcription.
Features:
Language-agnostic.
Very accurate but not user-friendly for general learners.
Example: 北京 → [peɪ˨˩˦ tɕiŋ˥˥]
6. Tongyong Pinyin
Purpose: Alternative romanization used in Taiwan before adopting Hanyu Pinyin.
Features:
Similar to Hanyu Pinyin but with some different spellings.
Example: 北京 → Běijing
7. Latinxua Sin Wenz
Purpose: Romanization system developed in the Soviet Union in the 1930s.
Features:
No tone markings.
Historically significant but rarely used today.
Applications of Phonetic Approximation Systems
Language learning: Helps learners pronounce Mandarin correctly.
Speech recognition and synthesis: Used in NLP and AI systems.
Input methods: Pinyin is the basis for most Chinese input systems on computers and phones.

For this I would like to use option 1 (pinyin)
