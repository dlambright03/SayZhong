🔧 Hybrid Spaced Repetition System for Mandarin Learning
🧠 From Mandarin Blueprint:
Use memory palaces and mnemonics to create vivid associations for characters.
Apply the Hanzi Movie Method: visualize characters as scenes involving actors, props, and settings.
Learn characters in context (phrases and sentences), not in isolation.
🔁 From Pandanese:
Implement a Leitner Box system to sort flashcards by difficulty.
Focus on radicals and components to build up character understanding.
Use bite-sized lessons and gamified review sessions to stay motivated.
📱 From Anki:
Use Anki’s SRS engine to schedule reviews based on recall strength.
Incorporate audio, stroke order animations, and example sentences.
Customize decks for HSK levels, tone practice, and sentence mining.
🧩 How to Combine Them
Feature	Tool	Integration Strategy
Character Visualization	Mandarin Blueprint	Use mnemonics and visual storytelling in flashcards.
Review Scheduling	Anki	Use Anki’s SRS algorithm to manage review intervals.
Difficulty Sorting	Pandanese	Add tags or fields in Anki to simulate Leitner boxes.
Contextual Learning	All	Include example sentences and audio in each card.
Gamification	Pandanese	Use Anki add-ons like “Review Heatmap” or “Leaderboard.”
