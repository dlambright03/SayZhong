# ADR-013: Lesson Planning & Content Sequencing Architecture

## Status
Accepted

## Context

The SayZhong Mandarin learning application requires an intelligent lesson planning and content sequencing system that can dynamically create personalized learning paths based on individual learner progress, assessment results, and effectiveness data. This system must adapt to the unique challenges of Mandarin learning while integrating seamlessly with our assessment framework (ADR-012), content management system (ADR-010), and learning effectiveness feedback loop (ADR-009).

### Mandarin-Specific Lesson Planning Challenges

1. **Skill Interdependencies**: Mandarin learning involves complex relationships between tones, pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar
2. **Progressive Complexity**: Content must be sequenced to build upon previously mastered concepts while introducing new complexity
3. **Phonetic English Integration**: Lessons must incorporate helpful pronunciation guides for English speakers
4. **Multi-Modal Learning**: Coordinating listening, speaking, reading, vocabulary, and grammar activities in coherent lessons
5. **HSK Alignment**: Ensuring lesson progression aligns with standardized Chinese proficiency levels
6. **Adaptive Pacing**: Adjusting lesson pace and content based on individual learning velocity and effectiveness

### Integration Requirements

- **Assessment Framework** (ADR-012): Use assessment results to inform lesson planning and sequencing
- **Content Management** (ADR-010): Access and sequence content from the curriculum framework
- **Learning Effectiveness** (ADR-009): Incorporate effectiveness analysis to optimize lesson design
- **UI Framework** (ADR-011): Deliver lessons through adaptive user interface components
- **AI Framework** (ADR-001): Leverage Semantic Kernel for intelligent lesson planning and adaptation
- **Data Storage** (ADR-003): Store lesson plans and sequencing data in Azure Data Lake

## Decision

We will implement an AI-powered, adaptive lesson planning and content sequencing architecture that creates personalized learning experiences by intelligently combining content from our curriculum framework based on individual learner needs, progress, and phonetic learning requirements.

## Rationale

### AI-Powered Personalization
- **Intelligent Planning**: Uses Semantic Kernel to create personalized lesson plans based on individual learner profiles
- **Adaptive Sequencing**: Dynamically adjusts content sequence based on learning effectiveness and progress
- **Phonetic Integration**: Ensures appropriate phonetic English guidance for pronunciation learning

### Multi-Strategy Sequencing
- **Flexible Approaches**: Supports spiral, linear, adaptive, and mastery-based sequencing strategies
- **Learner-Centric**: Chooses optimal sequencing strategy based on individual learning patterns
- **Effectiveness-Driven**: Uses effectiveness data to continuously optimize sequencing decisions

### Real-Time Adaptation
- **Immediate Response**: Adapts lessons in real-time based on learner engagement and comprehension
- **Seamless Experience**: Maintains lesson coherence while making necessary adaptations
- **Predictive Adaptation**: Anticipates learner needs before problems arise

### Phonetic Integration
- **Enhanced Pronunciation**: Phonetic English elements are seamlessly integrated into lesson content
- **English Speaker Support**: Provides intuitive pronunciation guidance for English speakers
- **Progressive Phonetic Learning**: Phonetic accuracy develops alongside Mandarin skills
