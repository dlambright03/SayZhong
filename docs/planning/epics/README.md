# SayZhong Epic Planning Overview

**Document Version**: 2.0  
**Last Updated**: June 2, 2025  
**Project**: SayZhong AI-Powered Mandarin Learning Platform

## Epic Structure Overview

The SayZhong project follows a proof-of-concept-first development strategy, organized into five strategic epics that deliver incremental, deployable value while building toward a comprehensive AI-powered Mandarin learning platform. Each epic represents a significant milestone with clear business value and technical deliverables.

**Development Philosophy**: We prioritize validating the core learning experience and AI capabilities through a local proof of concept before investing in full infrastructure and platform development.
