# Epic Planning: Conversational Mandarin Alignment Summary

**Date**: June 2, 2025  
**Author**: GitHub Copilot  
**Purpose**: Document complete alignment of SayZhong epic planning with conversational Mandarin learning focus

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive updates made to all SayZhong epics (000-004) to align with the conversational Mandarin learning approach that:
- **Eliminates Chinese characters** (no reading/writing focus)
- **Removes audio components** (no pronunciation assessment via audio)
- **Emphasizes English phonetic approximations** for pronunciation guidance
- **Prioritizes spoken vocabulary and conversation practice**
- **Implements POC-first validation approach**

## Epic Structure Changes

### New Epic 000: Proof of Concept (POC)
**Duration**: 2 weeks  
**Purpose**: Validate core conversational learning concepts before infrastructure investment

**Key Changes**:
- **Added POC as prerequisite** for all subsequent epics
- **Conversational focus validation**: 1000 most common spoken words
- **Phonetic approximation testing**: English pronunciation guidance patterns
- **AI conversation scenarios**: 7-10 speaking practice scenarios
- **No audio components**: Pure text-based pronunciation learning
- **No Chinese characters**: Pinyin + English + phonetic approximations only

### Epic Dependencies Updated
All epics now depend on POC completion:
- **Epic 001**: Depends on Epic 000 POC results
- **Epic 002**: Depends on Epic 000 + Epic 001
- **Epic 003**: Depends on Epic 000 + Epic 002
- **Epic 004**: Depends on Epic 000 + Epic 003

## Content Strategy Transformation

### From Character-Based to Conversation-Based

#### Before (Character Learning Focus):
- HSK Levels 1-3 curriculum (600+ words)
- Character recognition and writing exercises
- Audio pronunciation assessment
- Traditional reading/writing progression

#### After (Conversational Learning Focus):
- **2000+ most common spoken words** with phonetic approximations
- **Conversation scenarios** with cultural context
- **Pronunciation pattern explanations** using English approximations
- **Speaking confidence building** without character dependency

### Vocabulary Expansion Strategy
| Learning Stage | Vocabulary Count | Focus |
