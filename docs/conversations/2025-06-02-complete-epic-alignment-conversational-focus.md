- **Conversation scenario management** for speaking practice
- **Cultural context integration** for practical usage

## Content Strategy Transformation

### Before (Character Learning)
- HSK curriculum progression (Levels 1-3)
- Character recognition and writing
- Audio pronunciation assessment
- Reading comprehension focus

### After (Conversational Learning)
- **2000+ most common spoken words** with frequency-based progression
- **Conversation scenarios** with cultural context
- **English phonetic approximations** for pronunciation
- **Speaking confidence** and conversation mastery focus

## Success Metrics Evolution

### Learning Effectiveness
- **Vocabulary Retention**: 80%+ (spoken words vs. character recognition)
- **Speaking Confidence**: 50+ words/session mastery
- **Pronunciation Quality**: 4.5+ star phonetic approximation ratings
- **Conversation Completion**: 70%+ scenario completion rates

### User Engagement
