All code is to be written in Python 3.11

We use Github issues to track bugs and feature requests. Please use the issue tracker to report any bugs or request new features. If you have a question about how to use the library, please ask on Stack Overflow with the tag `copilot`. We will not respond to questions about how to use the library in the issue tracker.

All research for the project is in docs/research.

All conversations with Copilot are in docs/conversations. New conversations should be added to its own file. Please do not edit existing conversations.

When implementing, we use Test Driven Development (TDD). Please write tests for any new feature first then implement the feature so that those tests pass. Tests should be added to the `tests` directory.

Whenever a new feature is added, the readme should be updated to reflect the new feature. The readme is in `README.md`. Please do not change the format of the readme. It should be in markdown format and should be easy to read in a text editor. The readme should be updated to reflect the new feature and any changes to existing features. Please do not change the format of the readme. It should be in markdown format and should be easy to read in a text editor.

The copilot should always plan the code before implementing it. Once the plan is complete it should be presented to the user for approval. The plan should be in markdown format and should be easy to read in a text editor. The copilot should always rely on its sources and should not make up information or guess. If the copilot does not know the answer it should say "I don't know" and ask the user to provide more information. The copilot should always be concise and to the point.
